Deploy one million lights in a 1000x1000 grid
Lights in your grid are numbered from 0 to 999 in each direction;
	the lights at each corner are at 0,0, 0,999, 999,999, and 999,0.
The instructions include whether to turn on, turn off, or toggle various inclusive ranges given as coordinate pairs.
Each coordinate pair represents opposite corners of a rectangle, inclusive;
	a coordinate pair like 0,0 through 2,2 therefore refers to 9 lights in a 3x3 square.
The lights all start turned off.
For example:
turn on 0,0 through 999,999 would turn on (or leave on) every light.
toggle 0,0 through 999,0 would toggle the first line of 1000 lights, turning off the ones that were on, and turning on the ones that were off.
turn off 499,499 through 500,500 would turn off (or leave off) the middle four lights.

More examples:
turn off 660,55 through 986,197
turn off 341,304 through 638,850
turn off 199,133 through 461,193
toggle 322,558 through 977,958
toggle 537,781 through 687,941
turn on 226,196 through 599,390
turn on 240,129 through 703,297
turn on 317,329 through 451,798

Kata Goal: After following the instructions, how many lights are lit?
